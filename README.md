# United States Public Salary Data

I'm attempting to collect [public salary data from all 50 states](states.md), past or present
and I need your help. If you would like to contribute, feel free to create a
pull request and add the information you have.

You can add the following fields:

1. State: The name of the state
1. Link: A link in markdown format. It should follow this format `[domain name](url link)`
1. Government: Is the website a government website? `true` or `false`
1. Year Updated: The last year the dataset was updated
1. Exportable: Is there a file that can be exported: `true` or `false`
1. Type: The type of the file that can be exported:   `NA` (if not applicable), `csv`, `pdf`, `json`, etc 
1. Complete: Is the dataset complete? `true`, `false`, `unknown`
1. Socrata: Is the data hosted in a Socrata database? `true` or `false`

If you are interested in writing a scraper that will help pull data from these
websites, feel free to open an issue and a pull request and we'll figure out
our next steps.
